  "content": "Chapter 1\n\n\n\nIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice\nthat I've been turning over in my mind ever since.\n\n\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\" he told me, \"just\nremember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages\nthat you've had.\"\n\nHe didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative\nin a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more\nthan that. In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments,\na habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also\nmade me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind\nis quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it\nappears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I\nwas unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the\nsecret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were\nunsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile\nlevity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate\nrevelation was quivering on the horizon--for the intimate revelations\nof young men or at least the terms in which they express them are\nusually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving\njudgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of\nmissing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested,\nand I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is\nparcelled out unequally at birth.\n\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission\nthat it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet\nmarshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.\nWhen I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the\nworld to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\nwanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\nhuman heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\nexempt from my reaction--Gatsby who represented everything for which I\nhave an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\nsuccessful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\nto one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\nthousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\n\"creative temperament\"--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic\nreadiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it\nis not likely I shall ever find again. No--Gatsby turned out all right\nat the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the\nwake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the\nabortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\n\n\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western\ncity for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan and we\nhave a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the\nactual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in\nfifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale\nhardware business that my father carries on today.\n\nI never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look like him--with\nspecial reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in\nFather's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a\ncentury after my father, and a little later I participated in that\ndelayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the\ncounter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being\nthe warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the\nragged edge of the universe--so I decided to go east and learn the bond\nbusiness. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it\ncould support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it\nover as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said,\n\"Why--ye-es\" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance\nme for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I\nthought, in the spring of twenty-two.\n\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm\nseason and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees,\nso when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house\ntogether in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea. He found\nthe house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but\nat the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out\nto the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days\nuntil he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed\nand cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the\nelectric stove.\n\nIt was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently\narrived than I, stopped me on the road.\n\n\"How do you get to West Egg village?\" he asked helplessly.\n\nI told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a\npathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the\nfreedom of the neighborhood.\n\nAnd so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the\ntrees--just as things grow in fast movies--I had that familiar\nconviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.\n\nThere was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be\npulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen\nvolumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood\non my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to\nunfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas\nknew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.\nI was rather literary in college--one year I wrote a series of very\nsolemn and obvious editorials for the \"Yale News\"--and now I was going\nto bring back all such things into my life and become again that most\nlimited of all specialists, the \"well-rounded man.\" This isn't just an\nepigram--life is much more successfully looked at from a single window,\nafter all.\n\nIt was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of\nthe strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender\nriotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where\nthere are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of\nland. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in\ncontour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most\ndomesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great\nwet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals--like the\negg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact\nend--but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\nconfusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more\narresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except\nshape and size.\n\nI lived at West Egg, the--well, the less fashionable of the two, though\nthis is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little\nsinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the\negg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge\nplaces that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on\nmy right was a colossal affair by any standard--it was a factual\nimitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side,\nspanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool\nand more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion.\nOr rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by\na gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a\nsmall eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the\nwater, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling\nproximity of millionaires--all for eighty dollars a month.\n\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg\nglittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins\non the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom\nBuchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I'd known Tom\nin college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in\nChicago.\n\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of\nthe most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven--a\nnational figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute\nlimited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of\nanti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy--even in college his\nfreedom with money was a matter for reproach--but now he'd left Chicago\nand come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\ninstance he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.\nIt was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy\nenough to do that.\n\nWhy they came east I don't know. They had spent a year in France, for no\nparticular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever\npeople played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move,\nsaid Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it--I had no sight\ninto Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking\na little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable\nfootball game.\n\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East\nEgg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was\neven more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian\nColonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach\nand ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over\nsun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens--finally when it reached\nthe house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the\nmomentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows,\nglowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy\nafternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his\nlegs apart on the front porch.\n\nHe had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw haired\nman of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.\nTwo shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and\ngave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not\neven the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous\npower of that body--he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he\nstrained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle\nshifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body\ncapable of enormous leverage--a cruel body.\n\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\nfractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\nit, even toward people he liked--and there were men at New Haven who had\nhated his guts.\n\n\"Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final,\" he seemed to\nsay, \"just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are.\" We\nwere in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I\nalways had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like\nhim with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\n\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n\n\"I've got a nice place here,\" he said, his eyes flashing about\nrestlessly.\n\nTurning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the\nfront vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half\nacre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped\nthe tide off shore.\n\n\"It belonged to Demaine the oil man.\" He turned me around again,\npolitely and abruptly. \"We'll go inside.\"\n\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space,\nfragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.\nThe windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass\noutside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze\nblew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other\nlike pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of\nthe ceiling--and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a\nshadow on it as wind does on the sea.\n\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch\non which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored\nballoon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and\nfluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight\naround the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the\nwhip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.\nThen there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught\nwind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two\nyoung women ballooned slowly to the floor.\n\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length\nat her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised\na little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely\nto fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of\nit--indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having\ndisturbed her by coming in.\n\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise--she leaned slightly\nforward with a conscientious expression--then she laughed, an absurd,\ncharming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\nroom.\n\n\"I'm p-paralyzed with happiness.\"\n\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand\nfor a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one\nin the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had.\nShe hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker.\n(I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)\n\nAt any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\nimperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again--the object\nshe was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something\nof a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any\nexhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\n\nI looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low,\nthrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\ndown as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\nplayed again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\nbright eyes and a bright passionate mouth--but there was an excitement\nin her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\na singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had done\ngay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\nexciting things hovering in the next hour.\n\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east\nand how a dozen people had sent their love through me.\n\n\"Do they miss me?\" she cried ecstatically.\n\n\"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\npainted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all\nnight along the North Shore.\"\n\n\"How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" Then she added\nirrelevantly, \"You ought to see the baby.\"\n\n\"I'd like to.\"\n\n\"She's asleep. She's two years old. Haven't you ever seen her?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Well, you ought to see her. She's----\"\n\nTom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped\nand rested his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"What you doing, Nick?\"\n\n\"I'm a bond man.\"\n\n\"Who with?\"\n\nI told him.\n\n\"Never heard of them,\" he remarked decisively.\n\nThis annoyed me.\n\n\"You will,\" I answered shortly. \"You will if you stay in the East.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry,\" he said, glancing at\nDaisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.\n\"I'd be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else.\"\n\nAt this point Miss Baker said \"Absolutely!\" with such suddenness that I\nstarted--it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room.\nEvidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and\nwith a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\n\n\"I'm stiff,\" she complained, \"I've been lying on that sofa for as long\nas I can remember.\"\n\n\"Don't look at me,\" Daisy retorted. \"I've been trying to get you to New\nYork all afternoon.\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\npantry, \"I'm absolutely in training.\"\n\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\n\n\"You are!\" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of\na glass. \"How you ever get anything done is beyond me.\"\n\nI looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she \"got done.\" I enjoyed\nlooking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect\ncarriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the\nshoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at\nme with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented\nface. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her,\nsomewhere before.\n\n\"You live in West Egg,\" she remarked contemptuously. \"I know somebody\nthere.\"\n\n\"I don't know a single----\"\n\n\"You must know Gatsby.\"\n\n\"Gatsby?\" demanded Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\"\n\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced;\nwedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled\nme from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\n\nSlenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two\nyoung women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the\nsunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished\nwind.\n\n\"Why CANDLES?\" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\nfingers. \"In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year.\"\nShe looked at us all radiantly. \"Do you always watch for the longest day\nof the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the\nyear and then miss it.\"\n\n\"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\ntable as if she were getting into bed.\n\n\"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What'll we plan?\" She turned to me helplessly.\n\"What do people plan?\"\n\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\nlittle finger.\n\n\"Look!\" she complained. \"I hurt it.\"\n\nWe all looked--the knuckle was black and blue.\n\n\"You did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"I know you didn't mean to\nbut you DID do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man,\na great big hulking physical specimen of a----\"\n\n\"I hate that word hulking,\" objected Tom crossly, \"even in kidding.\"\n\n\"Hulking,\" insisted Daisy.\n\nSometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a\nbantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool\nas their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all\ndesire. They were here--and they accepted Tom and me, making only a\npolite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\nthat presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too\nwould be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the\nWest where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its\nclose in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer\nnervous dread of the moment itself.\n\n\"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my second glass\nof corky but rather impressive claret. \"Can't you talk about crops or\nsomething?\"\n\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an\nunexpected way.\n\n\"Civilization's going to pieces,\" broke out Tom violently.\n\"I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read\n'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n\n\"Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if\nwe don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged.\nIt's all scientific stuff; it's been proved.\"\n\n\"Tom's getting very profound,\" said Daisy with an expression of\nunthoughtful sadness. \"He reads deep books with long words in them.\nWhat was that word we----\"\n\n\"Well, these books are all scientific,\" insisted Tom, glancing at her\nimpatiently. \"This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us\nwho are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have\ncontrol of things.\"\n\n\"We've got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously\ntoward the fervent sun.\n\n\"You ought to live in California--\" began Miss Baker but Tom\ninterrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n\n\"This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are\nand----\" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a\nslight nod and she winked at me again. \"--and we've produced all the\nthings that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that.\nDo you see?\"\n\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency,\nmore acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost\nimmediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy\nseized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.\n\n\"I'll tell you a family secret,\" she whispered enthusiastically. \"It's\nabout the butler's nose. Do you want to hear about the butler's nose?\"\n\n\"That's why I came over tonight.\"\n\n\"Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for\nsome people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people.\nHe had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to\naffect his nose----\"\n\n\"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggested Miss Baker.\n\n\"Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up\nhis position.\"\n\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon\nher glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as\nI listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with\nlingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\n\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear\nwhereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went\ninside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned\nforward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n\n\"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an\nabsolute rose. Doesn't he?\" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation.\n\"An absolute rose?\"\n\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only\nextemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her\nheart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those\nbreathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the\ntable and excused herself and went into the house.\n\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of\nmeaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said \"Sh!\" in\na warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room\nbeyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The\nmurmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted\nexcitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n\n\"This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor----\" I said.\n\n\"Don't talk. I want to hear what happens.\"\n\n\"Is something happening?\" I inquired innocently.\n\n\"You mean to say you don't know?\" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.\n\"I thought everybody knew.\"\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"Why----\" she said hesitantly, \"Tom's got some woman in New York.\"\n\n\"Got some woman?\" I repeated blankly.\n\nMiss Baker nodded.\n\n\"She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time. Don't\nyou think?\"\n\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of\na dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back\nat the table.\n\n\"It couldn't be helped!\" cried Daisy with tense gayety.\n\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and\ncontinued: \"I looked outdoors for a minute and it's very romantic\noutdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale\ncome over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away----\" her\nvoice sang \"----It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?\"\n\n\"Very romantic,\" he said, and then miserably to me: \"If it's light enough\nafter dinner I want to take you down to the stables.\"\n\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her\nhead decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all\nsubjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the\nlast five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again,\npointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every\none and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom\nwere thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have\nmastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth\nguest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament\nthe situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to\ntelephone immediately for the police.\n\nThe horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\nBaker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into\nthe library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while\ntrying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed\nDaisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\nits deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\n\nDaisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and\nher eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent\nemotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some\nsedative questions about her little girl.\n\n\"We don't know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly.\n\"Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding.\"\n\n\"I wasn't back from the war.\"\n\n\"That's true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick,\nand I'm pretty cynical about everything.\"\n\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more,\nand after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\ndaughter.\n\n\"I suppose she talks, and--eats, and everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you what\nI said when she was born. Would you like to hear?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things. Well, she was less\nthan an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether\nwith an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it\nwas a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head\naway and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope\nshe'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world,\na beautiful little fool.\"\n\n\"You see I think everything's terrible anyhow,\" she went on in a\nconvinced way. \"Everybody thinks so--the most advanced people. And I KNOW.\nI've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.\"\nHer eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she\nlaughed with thrilling scorn. \"Sophisticated--God, I'm sophisticated!\"\n\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention,\nmy belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.\nIt made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick\nof some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited,\nand sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk\non her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather\ndistinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\n\n\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker\nsat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from\nthe \"Saturday Evening Post\"--the words, murmurous and\nuninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light,\nbright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair,\nglinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender\nmuscles in her arms.\n\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\n\n\"To be continued,\" she said, tossing the magazine on the table, \"in our\nvery next issue.\"\n\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she\nstood up.\n\n\"Ten o'clock,\" she remarked, apparently finding the time on the\nceiling. \"Time for this good girl to go to bed.\"\n\n\"Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained Daisy,\n\"over at Westchester.\"\n\n\"Oh,--you're JORdan Baker.\"\n\nI knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous\nexpression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of\nthe sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I\nhad heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story,\nbut what it was I had forgotten long ago.\n\n\"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won't you.\"\n\n\"If you'll get up.\"\n\n\"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\"\n\n\"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think I'll arrange\na marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of--oh--fling you\ntogether. You know--lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push\nyou out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing----\"\n\n\"Good night,\" called Miss Baker from the stairs. \"I haven't heard a word.\"\n\n\"She's a nice girl,\" said Tom after a moment. \"They oughtn't to let her\nrun around the country this way.\"\n\n\"Who oughtn't to?\" inquired Daisy coldly.\n\n\"Her family.\"\n\n\"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's\ngoing to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots of\nweek-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very\ngood for her.\"\n\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n\n\"Is she from New York?\" I asked quickly.\n\n\"From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our\nbeautiful white----\"\n\n\"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?\"\ndemanded Tom suddenly.\n\n\"Did I?\" She looked at me. \"I can't seem to remember, but I think\nwe talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of\ncrept up on us and first thing you know----\"\n\n\"Don't believe everything you hear, Nick,\" he advised me.\n\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later\nI got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by\nside in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy\nperemptorily called \"Wait!\n\n\"I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. We heard you were\nengaged to a girl out West.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" corroborated Tom kindly. \"We heard that you were\nengaged.\"\n\n\"It's libel. I'm too poor.\"\n\n\"But we heard it,\" insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in\na flower-like way. \"We heard it from three people so it must be true.\"\n\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely\nengaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the\nreasons I had come east. You can't stop going with an old friend on\naccount of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being\nrumored into marriage.\n\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely\nrich--nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove\naway. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of\nthe house, child in arms--but apparently there were no such intentions\nin her head. As for Tom, the fact that he \"had some woman in New York\"\nwas really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.\nSomething was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his\nsturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.\n\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside\ngarages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I\nreached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for\na while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown\noff, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and\na persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the\nfrogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the\nmoonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not\nalone--fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my\nneighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets\nregarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\nmovements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested\nthat it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was\nhis of our local heavens.\n\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and\nthat would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him for he gave\na sudden intimation that he was content to be alone--he stretched out his\narms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him\nI could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and\ndistinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away,\nthat might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby\nhe had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.\n",
